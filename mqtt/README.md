# MQTT Client Plugin

## 1. Build(tested on Linux 64bit GCC version 5.4.0)

* This plugin has been successfully compiled with GCC (version 5.4.0) on 64-bits Linux operating system.
* Before compiling, install [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

For Ubuntu users, just type

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install git cmake
```
* Create a 'build' directory. Under the directory, run `cmake ..` and `make` to generate 'libPluginMQTTClient.so'.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## 2. Load Plugin

Use function `loadPlugin` to load MQTT client plugin.

```
loadPlugin("/YOUR_PATH/mqtt/PluginMQTTClient.txt"); 
```
Note:the path should be modified according to the situation.

## 3. Publish
### 3.1 Connect to  a MQTT server/broker

**Syntax**

```
mqtt::connect(host, port,[QoS=0],[formatter],[batchSize=0])
```
The function connect to a MQTT server/broker. .

**Arguments**

- 'host' is a string indicating the IP address of MQTT server/broker.

- 'port' is an integer indicating the port number of MQTT server/broker.

- 'Qos' is an integer indicating the quality of service. 0: at most once; 1: at least once; 2: only once. It is optional and the default value is 0.

- 'formatter' is a function,this is used to package published data in a format. Currently supported functions are createJsonFormatter and createCsvFormatter.

- 'batchSize' is an integer,when the content to be published is a table, it can be sent in batches, and batchSize indicates the number of rows sent each time.

It returns a connection object which can be explicitly called to close the close function, or it can be automatically released when the reference count is 0. 

**Example**
```
f=createCsvFormatter([INT, TIMESTAMP, DOUBLE, DOUBLE,DOUBLE], ',', ';' )
conn=connect("test.mosquitto.org",1883,0,f,50)
```

### 3.2 Publish

**Syntax**

```
mqtt::publish(conn,topic,obj)
```

This function posts one or more messages to the MQTT server/broker

**Arguments**

- 'conn' is an object generated by function

- 'topic' is a string indicating the subscription topic.

- 'obj' is the content of the message to be published, which can be a table or a string or an array of strings.


**Example**

```
mqtt::publish(conn,"dolphindb/topic1","welcome")
mqtt::publish(conn,"devStr/sensor001",["hello world","welcome"])
t=table(take(0..99,50) as hardwareId ,take(now(),
		50) as ts,rand(20..41,50) as temperature,
		rand(50,50) as humidity,rand(500..1000,
		50) as voltage)
mqtt::publish(conn,"dolphindb/device",t)		

``` 

### 3.3 Close the connection

**Syntax**

```
mqtt::close(conn)
```

This function disconnects from the server/broker.

**Arguments**

- 'conn' is an object generated by function.

**Example**
```
mqtt::close(conn)
```

## 4. Subscribe/Unsubscribe

### 4.1 Subscribe

**Syntax**

```
mqtt::subscribe(host, port, topic,parser, handler)
```

**Arguments**

- 'host' is a string indicating the IP address of MQTT server/broker.

- 'port' is an integer indicating the port number of MQTT server/broker.

- 'topic' is a string indicating the subscription topic.

- 'parser' is a function for parsing subscribed messages. Currently supported functions are createJsonParser and createCsvParser

- 'handler' is a function or a table to process the subscribed data.

**Details**

Subscribe to a MQTT server/broker. It returns a connection object which can be explicitly called to close the close function, or it can be automatically released when the reference count is 0. 

**Example**

```
p = createCsvParser([INT, TIMESTAMP, DOUBLE, DOUBLE,DOUBLE], ',', ';' )
sensorInfoTable = table( 10000:0,`deviceID`send_time`temperature`humidity`voltage ,[INT, TIMESTAMP, DOUBLE, DOUBLE,DOUBLE])
 
conn = mqtt::subscribe("192.168.1.201",1883,"sensor/#",p,sensorInfoTable)
```

### 4.2 Unsubscribe

**Syntax**

```
mqtt::unsubcribe(conn)  
```

**Arguments**

- 'conn' is the value returned by the subscribe function.

**Example**

```
mqtt::unsubcribe(conn)    
```
